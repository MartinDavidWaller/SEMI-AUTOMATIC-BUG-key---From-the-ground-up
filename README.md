 ## Required Parts
 
 The following parts are all 3D printed. The table below details the part, the colour, the infill, 
 and the approximate length of PLA required. If parts seem too 'bendy' then you may like to increase
 the infill percentage when printing.

## Assembly

Assembly is quite easy. Below are the steps to follow. The only required tools are a screw driver and small pliers.

### Step 1

Install 3 binding posts. These provide connections to the keyer. Each post requires:

* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 1
* Pinted Binding Post * 1
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Washer * 1

Expect to bury one nut within the body of the binding post. See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 2

Install 2 binding posts. These provide connections to the DIT and DAH contacts. Each post requires:

* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 2
* Pinted Binding Post * 1
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Washer * 1

These are constructed in the same way as the binding posts in step 1 apart from there being an extra solder tag on the top side
of the board. See the images below for the detailed construction.
