 ## Required Parts
 
 The following parts are all 3D printed. The table below details the part, the colour, the infill, 
 and the approximate length of PLA required. If parts seem too 'bendy' then you may like to increase
 the infill percentage when printing.

## Assembly

Assembly is quite easy. Below are the steps to follow. The only required tools are a screwdriver and small pliers.

### Step 1

Install 3 binding posts. These provide connections to the keyer. Each post requires:

* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 1
* Printed Binding Post * 1
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Washer * 1

Expect to bury one nut within the body of the binding post. See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 2

Install 2 binding posts. These provide connections to the DIT and DAH contacts. Each post requires:

* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 2
* Printed Binding Post * 1
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Washer * 1

These are constructed in the same way as the binding posts in step 1 apart from there being an extra solder tag on the top side
of the board. See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 3

Install the knob and knob plate on the yoke. This requires:

* M2 Bolt 6mm * 1
* M2 Nut * 1
* M3 Bolt 12mm * 1
* M3 Nut * 1
* Printed Yoke * 1

Start by bolting the knob plate to the yoke using the M2 nut and bolt. The M2 nut should be buried in the yoke itself. 
Insert the M3 nut into the slot in the side of the knob and temporarily insert the M3 bolt in the bottom and screw home. 
This simply ensures that the nut is correctly positioned, remove the bolt. Push the M3 bolt through the knob plate, through
yoke, and into the knob. Position it so that the slot in the knob is pointing downwards and out of sight.
See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 4

Install the DIT contact in the lever arm. This requires:

* M3 Bolt 6mm * 1
* M3 Nut * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 1

Simply insert the bolt through the solder tab and then through the lever arm. The nut is buried in the lever arm itself.
See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Setp 5

Assemble the DIT and DAH short contact posts. Each post requires:

* M3 Knurled Bolt 20mm * 1
* M3 Knulred Nut * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 2
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* Printed Short Contact Post * 2

Starting at the top put the knurled nut onto the knurled bolt and screw it all the way down. 
Pass the bolt thought the 3mm hole in the side of the contact post and put one 3mm solder 
tag and 3mm nut on the other size and screw home so that the nut is pulled into the contact 
post. At the bottom push the hoop end of a 3mm solder tag into the contact post and above 
that push in a 3mm nut. Screw the M3 bolt up through the bottom until it has passed through
the nut. You should then be able to bend the bottom 3mm solder tag over the 3mm nut so that 
it makes contact with the upper 3mm solder tag. The solder tag can then be soldered together. 
This can be done in situ but it is best to disassemble and solder them separately.
See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 6

Assemble the DIT rest. This requires:

* M3 Knurled Bolt 20mm * 1
* M3 Knulred Nut * 1
* Printed Main Frame * 1

Put the 3mm knurled nut on to the 3mm knurled bolt and screw it half way down. Push the end of the 
3mm bolt through the right hand arm of the body and add the 3mm nut. Scren this hold until the nut is
pulled into the arm. See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 7

Assemble the DIT tension. This requires:

* M3 Knurled Bolt 20mm * 1
* M3 Knulred Nut * 1
* M3 Nut * 3
* Printed Spring Cup * 1

Put the M3 knurled nut on to the M3 knurled bolt and screw it all the way down. Push the end of the 
3mm bolt through the left hand arm of the body. Add two further M3 nuts, the sprint cup with the 
opening facing to the right, and a further M3 nut. The last two M3 nuts need to be adjusted to hold
the print cup tight at the end of the M3 knurled bolt. The inner M3 nut needs to be pulled into the
arm screwing home the bolt. See the images below for the detailed construction.
